# üß† Software Stack Overview {align="center"}

<p align="center">The brains of SMapper</p>

---

SMapper runs a robust and modular software stack designed to handle the full pipeline of **data acquisition**, **real-time processing**, **visualization**, and **storage**‚Äîall on-device, thanks to the onboard **Jetson AGX Orin Developer Kit (64GB)**.

The stack brings together **ROS 2 nodes**, **custom software packages**, and **web-based interfaces** to provide a streamlined experience for both field operations and remote monitoring.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Runtime

- **Base OS & Platform**  
  The system runs **JetPack 6.0**, chosen to maintain compatibility with the **e-Con Systems Argus cameras**, which require a **custom kernel** only supported by this version.

- **ROS 2 Distribution**  
  All robot-centric components operate on **ROS 2 Humble**, ensuring long-term support and compatibility across the ecosystem.

- **Sensor Data Flow**
    - Sensor drivers (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs) publish to ROS topics.
    - A **LiDAR odometry** node estimates pose in real-time.
    - Data is recorded into **ROS 2 bag files** for offline processing.

## üåê API & Web Interface

Alongside the ROS stack, SMapper hosts a **local hotspot** that runs:

- A **REST API** to control data capture, monitor system status, and trigger recordings.
- A **web application** for real-time visualization, interaction, and metadata management.
- This very **documentation site**, served locally for offline access in the field.

These services communicate with ROS through a **ROS bridge**, allowing real-time updates (e.g., live point clouds or pose trajectories) to appear directly in the browser.
