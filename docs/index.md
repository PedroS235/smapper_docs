**SMapper** is a portable, high-performance platform built for one purpose: capturing exceptional multimodal datasets for SLAM[^1] research and development. Whether you're mapping new environments, benchmarking algorithms, or pushing the boundaries of autonomous robotics, SMapper gives you the tools to collect the data that matters.

At its core, SMapper combines a precisely aligned LiDAR sensor with a synchronized multi-camera array featuring overlapping fields of view[^2], ensuring every frame is rich with spatial and visual information. Everything is handled in real-time by the Jetson AGX Orin, enabling on-the-spot processing and fast iteration in the field.

But SMapper isn‚Äôt just about performance‚Äîit‚Äôs built for mobility and versatility. Despite packing serious hardware, it‚Äôs light enough (~2kg) to carry comfortably, thanks to balanced weight distribution and a thoughtfully designed handle. For even more flexibility, the system can be mounted directly onto ground robots, including legged platforms, using either its standard grip or a custom mounting solution.

Fieldwork is demanding, so SMapper is powered by standard drill batteries‚Äîeasy to swap and quick to charge, letting you extend your missions without hunting for proprietary parts.

In an era where high-quality, diverse datasets are key to real-world robotics, SMapper provides a reliable way to gather the data you need‚Äîaccurately, efficiently, and wherever your experiments take you.
