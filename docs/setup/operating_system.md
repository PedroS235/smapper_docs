# Operating System

SMapper is powered by the Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin. Therfore, the operating system used
is the Jetpack 6.0. Although newer versions exist, the eCAM cameras require Jetpack 6.0 due
to their kernel modification and up until the writing of this page 6.0 is the latest version supported.

In order to install Jetpack, one must use the Nvidia SDK and install the Jetpack
by flashing it by connecting a USB-C cable to the debug port, or by using a Ethernet cable.
